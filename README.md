## ImageMagick

The build process transcodes and embeds images to optimize display of images, including exporting WEBP images to be loaded in compatible browsers. Build relies on a compatible install of ImageMagick in the path. Specifically, the insalled version should support SVG, WEBP and have Little CMS support.

### OS-X & Homebrew

```bash
$ brew reinstall imagemagick --with-webp --with-little-cms2 --with-librsvg
```
